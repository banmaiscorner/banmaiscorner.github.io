        <h1>Hi! I am Ban-Mai.</h1>

        <p>	"Mai" name is Mai. Mai is pronounced like "my" in "my name is Mai." Mai is not pronounced like Maya, nor Mike, nor mine. Mai is pronounced like "my" in "my name is Mai," which is enough and correct.</p>
		<p>Mai is fourteen years old. Though her biological body keeps getting older, Mai has been always fourteen years old since her fourteenth birthday, which was ten years ago.</p>
		<p>Mai is a teenager, so she is hungry. She is hungry for understandings, comprehension, mastery and knowledge as much as she is hungry for food. She can spend hours in the library to figure out why kids' products always have bright and pastel colors. She can also spend days to practice drawing hands. She wants to become an excellent and famous artist.</p>
		<p>Mai is not only hungry, she is also foolish. She wants to save the world. No. Not really. She does not want to be a superhero. Mai only wants to make a better world. However, she has not made anything big yet. She just smiles every morning, at everybody she meets. If she has a chance, she tells them a story. Sometimes stories are silly and stupid, but she keeps telling them, in the hope that she can help people she meets have a good start of their day. Moreover, Mai also believes that being an excellent and famous artist can help her make the world better. </p>
		<p>I am Mai. My name is Mai. Mai is pronounced like "my" in "my name is Mai." Mai is not pronounced like Maya, nor Mike, nor mine. Mai is pronounced like "my" in "my name is Mai," which is enough and correct.</p>
